## Who I am

My name is Matthew Wilkes and I make thingssome times. I work for the 
Third Sector from Edinburgh as a software developer. My main interests are:

* Software for charities;
* Data and systems architecture;
* Open source software;
* Linux;
* The web;
* JavaScript;
* Future technologies;
* Deflated software;
* Lefty politics; and
* Social justice.

Although I list JavaScript as my main interest I'm really into programming
as a whole. I spent nearly 10 years in .NET, working with Oracle, SqlServer,
and hosting stuff on Azure, along the way there was intermittent PHP (for 
my sins). Through out all that I maintained an interest in Javascript and 
what you can achieve with it. I am by no stretch a front-end UX master but
have always appreciated the flexibility and madness that is ECMAScript.

Over the last couple of years I have been working a lot with Node.js and
Angular which even though can be often be frustrating, I find greatly 
satisfying. I freely admit that JavaScript is a nightmare language that 
encourages lazy coding, bad practices, and hacks; but like with any language 
when treated properly it can be really powerful. Innovations like TypeScript 
certainly help. All that aside, I want to do more serious programming and 
hopefully this site and my push to do more will see me doing a lot more
proper programming. Who knows, I may even finally do something substantial
in C. 

## Why the site

I've owned the domain name for 15 years and have never successfully kept
a site going. I seem to be getting a bit more active in just doing stuff
and often want a place to write it down or share it. In an attempt to
beat imposter syndrome I'm going to put as much of my stuff online to get
more confident about my work. This means using GitHub a lot more for my
latest attempts to learn stuff.

I've been writing software for a living since 2006 and programming since 2001
so I think sometimes have nifty ideas that might help someone out there. Not 
looking to make this site/blog/project list super famous or anything but at 
some point someone out there might stumble across I problem I've solved and 
benefit from it.

I have recently been attempting to live almost entirely in a linux terminal,
only surfacing to use Google Chrome. I hope to document a bunch of the
useful stuff I have learnt on here. This will include configurations, and 
plugins for all of the stuff I use such as vim, WeeChat, and mutt. I've
started doing this as a way to challenge myself but to also master some 
truly powerful tools. With fewer distractions and having an environment 
setup exactly how I want I will hopefully be more productive. Valuable seconds
are wasted by moving your hand to a mouse.

## Where to find me

I never if ever do social media but can be found on:

## Site tech

This site is being hosted using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
so is a pretty simple [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) setup. I'm using 
[Material Design Lite](https://getmdl.io/) as the basis for my stylings and 
my editor of choice is [vim](http://www.vim.org/) which is obviously heavily
customised. [You can see my dotfiles here](https://github.com/tonicblue/dotfiles).
The banner images are randomly selected from [Unsplash](https://source.unsplash.com/)
which is a fantastic resource for free to use images. If you are using a decent
browser to view this site you will have noticed that I'm doing some pretty heavy
CSS filtering on them.
